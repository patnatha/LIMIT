# LIMIT Archive

## OVERVIEW
This directory to for catalogging the original code as written by Dr. Poole et. al. in their paper that described the algorithm. While the processing and application of the algorithm has been extensively modified. The basis of the algorithm remains the same and the goal of this implementation is to replicate the algorithm described in their paper.
